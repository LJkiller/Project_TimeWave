How to properly set up TimeWave:
1. Go into .env-sample (or create a new .env file) and give your MONGODB_CONNECTIONSTRING, PORT and HASHING_ROUNDS.
2. Go into your own MongoDB Compass, create a new database: timeWave.
3. In timeWave, create three new collections: 'accounts', 'splashes' and 'tides'.
